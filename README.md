<h1>Whazzapp : Stripe App & Whatsapp Cloud API integration</h1>

<p>
This Stripe app is a simple build where we've linked Stripe with WhatsApp so that we can send templated messages and track read receipts.
</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send Checkout links directly to Customers via WhatsApp from the Stripe Dashbaord</li>
    <li>Create a Subscription and send WhatApp messages based on webhooks</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>
